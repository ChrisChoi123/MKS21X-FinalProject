# MKS21X-FinalProject
Developmental Log:
1/3 Created a constructor that creates a char[][] filled with the respective colors for the 6 sides. Also a toString() that returns the contents in the char[][].

1/4 Created a rotateSide() method that rotate the stickers of a single side when a clockwise turn is applied. This is the first out of 2 private methods that will be used for a complete rotate layer method.
